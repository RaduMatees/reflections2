R1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Initializing a repository adds all of git functionality for that folder.
Specifically, it adds a .git hidden folder which contains metadata for tracking
the repositories history, and probably other git stuff functionality.

R2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is a middle ground between the working directory and the repository.
It is a way to organize your commits even further. For instance, if you have to
make some changes to more than one file so you can make one logical commit, this is
where the staging area come into play.
